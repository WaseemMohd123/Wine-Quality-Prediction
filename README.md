🍷 Wine Quality Prediction
This project uses a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical properties like acidity, pH, alcohol, and more. The model is built using the Random Forest Classifier and provides insights into feature importance for quality prediction.

📌 Key Features
